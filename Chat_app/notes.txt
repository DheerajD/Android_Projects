Create WelcomeActivity

Go to layout xml file and change layout to RelativeLayout.

Replace DarkActionBar with NoActionBar from styles.xml file. We don't need action bar at the top.

in colors.xml, replaced the values to my shades of blue. Just copy any color on google to get a shade. Select your colors from pallate.

I'll be working with Firebase database. For using firebase we need to have a gmail account.

Connect Android Studio to Gmail by logging in from Android studio. Small Icon at top right corner. Once we are logged in we can use Firebase database.

Click on Tools -> Firebase. This will open Firebase assistant.

In Firebase asistant. Select Authentication -> Email and password authentication.

Under email and pwd authentication tab -> Connect to Firebase -> opens a dailog box - connect to firebase.
This creates a firebase project inside a firebase database by the name of ChatApp. This completes the first step.

for Step 2, click on Add firebase authentication to your app. -> Accept changes.
This adds authentication dependencies inside our app.

Step 3 -> go back. Select realtime Database. Click on save and retrieve data.
Click on Add the Realtime Database to your App.

I got error : Failed to resolve: firebase-auth:16.0.1:15.0.0'
Replaced this with  firebase-auth:16.0.1. i.e. Write : implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:16.0.1:15.0.0' 


Step 4-> Go back. Click on Cloud messaging. Setup firebase cloud messaging. Add FCM to your app.

basically added these to gradle file :  
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:16.0.1'    
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database:16.0.1'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:17.0.0'






Now, go on browser. go to https://firebase.google.com/
On top right corner we have option "GO TO CONSOLE". Here we can see that our ChatApp Application is created successfully.

Select the application. On left panel, we have our Authentication, database options.

Click on Authentication - select "sign-in method"
